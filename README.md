# Peeling Rage

## Motivation

Peeling Rage is my personal blog/website. I use it to document the things I am learning using my own words. It is inspired from the idea that the best way to learn is to teach as well as [swyx](https://github.com/sw-yx)'s learn in public blog [post](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/).

## Technologies

I have also used this little project as an opportunity to get exposed to [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and learn some more about it.

## Credits

The gatsby site builds on top of [andrezzoid](https://github.com/andrezzoid/)'s [gatsby-starter-blog-tailwindcss](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/andrezzoid/gatsby-starter-blog-tailwindcss/).
