# Peeling Rage

## Motivation

Peeling Rage is my personal blog/website. I use it to document the things I am learning using my own words. It is inspired from the idea that the best way to learn is to teach as well as [swyx](https://github.com/sw-yx)'s learn in public blog [post](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/).

### What does Peeling Rage mean ?

I usually enjoy unraveling abstractions, and more often that not, I find myself spending a lot of time trying to understand how X works under the hood. I am not always successful unfortunately, but I do enjoy trying. With that being said, unraveling often happens from top to bottom, layer by layer .. just like an ... **onion**. The "**Rage**" part is inspired from "Road Rage". A similiar feeling of frustration I start having when I start "peeling" too much ðŸ˜“ or loose myself in details.

## Technologies

I have also used this little project as an opportunity to get exposed to [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and learn some more about it.

## Credits

The gatsby site builds on top of [andrezzoid](https://github.com/andrezzoid/)'s [gatsby-starter-blog-tailwindcss](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/andrezzoid/gatsby-starter-blog-tailwindcss/).
